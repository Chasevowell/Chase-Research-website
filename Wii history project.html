    <h1 class="Wii">The Nintendo Wii was released by the Nintendo Company of Japan in 2006.</h1>
    <h3 class="Wii">While the Wii was underpowered compared to its competition such as the Microsoft Xbox 360 and Sony PlayStation 3 >But what separated the Wii from its competitors was it low cost and effective marketing and many Nintendo exclusive games. The Wii hit shelves on November, 19, 2006, In North America and December 2006 for many other regions throughout the globe. While in development the Wii faced many issues mainly competing with Microsoft Xbox and Sony PlayStation The Wii could not compare with computational graphics and power That was included with these consoles. Although under powered the Wii did boast some impressive technology for the time. The Wii's central processing unit is an IBM PowerPC-based processor with a clock frequency of 729 MHz. The reduced size of processer resulted in 20% lowered power consumption. While the GPU core processing power  243 MHz, 3 MB of texture memory, digital signal processors, and input/output functions. Additionally the GPU included an additional 24 MB of 1T-SRAM and an additional 64 MB of 1T-SRAM on the motherboard, totaling to 88 MB of memory for the console. The Wii's total processing power was 1.5 to 2 times as powerful as the GameCube. The Wii's motherboard has also equipped with a  Wi-Fi adapter, And a Blue tooth antenna that is used to connected with its controllers. The Wii also fully supports USB-based LAN adapter can connect the Wii to a wired Ethernet network. The Wii uses  an optical media drive located in the front of the device to read disks </h1>

    <h1>Development</h1>

    <h3 class="qw"> During the development of the Wii, The president of Nintendo Satoru Iwata directed the company to target a larger  demographic marketing to novice video game consumers instead of the hardcore audience. Shying a way from the traditional approach other game companies lead the Wii to becoming the highest bought console of the 2010's. During the infancy of the Wii which was developing under the code name Revolution. During this time Nintendo started to work with Gyration Inc. Which was firm that developed several patents related to motion detection. Over the next two years Satoru Iwata, who had been promoted to Nintendo's president in May 2002 following Hiroshi Yamauchi's retirement recognized that Nintendo had been lagging behind the competition. Nintendo had been struggling keeping up with trends in the video game industry, such as adapting to online gaming. He also thought Nintendo was becoming too  exclusive and wanted Nintendo to pursue gaming hardware and software that would appeal to all demographics. Nintendo's market  analysis discovered that their novel hardware had created consoles that made it difficult for third-party developers to create games for. This causing Nintendo to suffer. Miyamoto led the development of a new type of controller, based on Gyration's motion-sensing technology. Iwata proposed that this new console would use motion  sensing to simplify the gaming interface. The first prototype was finished in 6 months. In 2004 Iwata had finally released information to the public about this exciting new console.  </h3>

    <h3 class="h">The Wii remote is the primary controller for the console. the remote has a MEMS-based three-dimension accelerometer, along with infrared detection sensors located at the far end of the controller. The accelerometer allow the Wii to sense the controller with out the use of cords or wires. The infrared detectors are used to track the emissions from LEDs in the included Sensor Bar. Which need to be used for the remote to work. This gives the Wii remote the pointing ability like a computer mouse to the screen. The Wii remote has a range of 15 feet range for accurate detection. The remote also includes 4 buttons to control the system along with a power button to turn off the console. To power the controller itself two double A batteries are needed. The controller connects to the console by Bluetooth. A speaker is on the controller and even a rumble pack. This pack allows the Controller to have vibrations. The controller went through a re-design in late 2010. This re-design makes the controller more accurate. A multitude of  accessors can be added to the controller to improve the quality of the controller.   </h3>
